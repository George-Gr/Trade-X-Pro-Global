## 💡 Key Psychological Principles Applied

### Cialdini's 6 Principles
1. **Authority** → Navy + Serif typography
2. **Social Proof** → Leaderboards + verified badges
3. **Reciprocity** → Free education first
4. **Scarcity** → Gold accents signal exclusivity
5. **Consistency** → Every interaction feels familiar
6. **Liking** → Beautiful, warm aesthetics

### Consumer Psychology Biases
- **Loss Aversion** → Stop-loss made prominent
- **Status Quo Bias** → Gradual changes, tutorials
- **Availability Heuristic** → Real-time metrics visible
- **Anchoring Effect** → Starting balance as anchor
- **Endowment Effect** → Portfolio growth celebrated
- **Sunk Cost** → Gamification badges
- **Peak-End Rule** → Success celebration animations

### Trading-Specific Psychology
- **Margin calls** → Gold warning (caution, not panic)
- **Profit visualization** → Animations celebrate wins (dopamine hit)
- **Risk controls** → Stop-loss prominence (safety)
- **Community** → Social proof reduces trading anxiety
