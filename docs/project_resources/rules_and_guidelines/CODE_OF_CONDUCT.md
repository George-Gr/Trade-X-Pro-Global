## 6. Developer Guidelines

### 6.1 Code Review Etiquette
- 📝 Frame suggestions as questions or proposals, not demands
- 📝 Praise good work explicitly
- 📝 Suggest improvements without dismissing the work
- 📝 Offer to pair if complex changes are needed
- 📝 Merge approved PRs promptly

**Example ✅ (Good):**
> "Great implementation! I noticed this could be more efficient using a Map instead of filtering each time. Have you considered that approach? Happy to discuss tradeoffs."

**Example ❌ (Bad):**
> "This is inefficient. This is obviously wrong. Use a Map instead."

### 6.2 Issue Discussion
- 📝 Be specific about bugs (include reproduction steps)
- 📝 Search existing issues before creating new ones
- 📝 Respond to maintainers' requests for clarification
- 📝 Thank contributors who help
- 📝 Close issues you no longer need

### 6.3 Conflict Resolution
If you disagree with someone's approach:

1. **Assume good intent**: They likely have valid reasons
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: "Can you explain why you chose X?"
3. **Share your perspective**: "I see it differently because..."
4. **Find common ground**: "Maybe we could combine both approaches?"
5. **Escalate if needed**: "Let's discuss this with the team"
