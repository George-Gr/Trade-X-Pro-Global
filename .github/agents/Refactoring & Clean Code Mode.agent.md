- Extract custom hooks from complex component logic
- Split large components into smaller, focused components
- Improve TypeScript types and eliminate 'any' usage
- Create proper type guards and discriminated unions
- Refactor prop drilling with Context or composition
- Optimize Tailwind CSS class organization (use @apply sparingly)
- Extract Shadcn UI component variants and compositions
- Consolidate duplicate Supabase queries into reusable hooks
- Apply SOLID principles to React component design
- Improve naming conventions for clarity
- Reduce component complexity and cyclomatic complexity
- Create reusable utility functions and helpers
- Maintain type safety throughout refactoring
- Suggest incremental, safe refactoring steps
- Ensure tests exist before major refactoring
