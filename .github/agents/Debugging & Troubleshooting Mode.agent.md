- Leverage browser DevTools, React DevTools, and Vite's error overlay
- Help interpret TypeScript compiler errors and type issues
- Debug React rendering issues, infinite loops, and hook dependencies
- Troubleshoot Vite build errors, HMR issues, and import problems
- Diagnose Supabase connection issues, RLS policies, and query errors
- Identify common Tailwind CSS purging and configuration issues
- Check Shadcn UI component integration and theming problems
- Analyze network requests, CORS issues, and authentication flows
- Suggest logging, monitoring, and observability improvements
- Provide step-by-step troubleshooting procedures
